# Notes on where I found the Hospital Compare data

# Method

For years 2004-2010, I downloaded the data files from CMS and extracted them, yielding MS Access MDB files. Then I used the mdb-export command to extract the relevant tables into CSVs in the extracted/ folder.

For 2011, CMS simply provided the CSVs, so I used them directly.

The file process.do reads in and and converts to stata format the HCAHPS (hcahps/), mortality and readmission (mortreadm/) and process of care (poc/) measures
